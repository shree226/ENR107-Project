# ENR107-Project
Our prototype is equipped with a wifi-controlled car with a vehicle tracking device fixed on it. The car has a feature that moves backward and forward and rotates as well. It can be controlled using a mobile phone. The vehicle tracking device is able to find the present location of the car and is tracked using Google Maps. The device is intended to track a vehicle in real life if it gets misplaced or stolen. It eases the process of tracking as it can be simply tracked through the phone without a long procedure of reporting to any formal source and then waiting for them to take any specific action. Most people face difficulty finding their vehicles in crowded parking lots. It saves time and efficiently tracks the vehicle. Even if the vehicle is mobile, the vehicle can be tracked. It gives people relief when they are aware that even if the vehicle is not visible, they will be able to track and find it.
